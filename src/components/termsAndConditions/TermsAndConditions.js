                  We cannot guarantee the Site will be available at all times.
                  We may experience hardware, software, or other problems or

                </p>
                <h4>16. Dispute Resolution</h4>
                <h5>Informal Negotiations</h5>
                <p>
                  To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute,
                  controversy, or claim related to these Terms of Use (each
                  "Dispute" and collectively, the “Disputes”) brought by either
                  you or us (individually, a “Party” and collectively, the
                  “Parties”), the Parties agree to first attempt to negotiate
                  any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly provided below)
                  informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating
                  arbitration. Such informal negotiations commence upon written
                  notice from one Party to the other Party.
                </p>
                <h5>Binding Arbitration</h5>
                <p>
                  If the Parties are unable to resolve a Dispute through
                  informal negotiations, the Dispute (except those Disputes
                  expressly excluded below) will be finally and exclusively
                  resolved through binding arbitration. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT
                  WITHOUT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN
                  COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The arbitration shall be
                  commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules
                  of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") and, where
                  appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer
                  Related Disputes ("AAA Consumer Rules"), both of which are
                  available at the AAA website: www.adr.org. Your arbitration
                  fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be
                  governed by the AAA Consumer Rules and, where appropriate,
                  limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. The arbitration may be
                  conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by
                  phone, or online. The arbitrator will make a decision in
                  writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless
                  requested by either Party. The arbitrator must follow
                  applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the
                  arbitrator fails to do so. Except where otherwise required by
                  the applicable AAA rules or applicable law, the arbitration
                  will take place in Queens, New York. Except as otherwise
                  provided herein, the Parties may litigate in court to compel
                  arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to
                  confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award
                  entered by the arbitrator.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If for any reason, a Dispute proceeds in court rather than
                  arbitration, the Dispute shall be commenced or prosecuted in
                  the state and federal courts located in Queens, New York, and
                  the Parties hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of lack
                  of personal jurisdiction, and forum non conveniens with
                  respect to venue and jurisdiction in such state and federal
                  courts. Application of the United Nations Convention on
                  Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform
                  Computer Information Transaction Act (UCITA) is excluded from
                  these Terms of Use.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In no event shall any Dispute brought by either Party related
                  in any way to the Site be commenced more than two (2) years
                  after the cause of action arose. If this provision is found to
                  be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to
                  arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this
                  provision found to be illegal or unenforceable, and such
                  Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction
                  within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the
                  Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that
                  court.

                <p>
                  These Terms of Use and any policies or operating rules posted
                  by us on the Site or in respect to the Site constitute the
                  entire agreement and understanding between you and us. Our
                  failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these
                  Terms of Use shall not operate as a waiver of such right or
                  provision. These Terms of Use operate to the fullest extent
                  permissible by law. We may assign any or all of our rights and
                  obligations to others at any time. We shall not be responsible
                  or liable for any loss, damage, delay, or failure to act
                  caused by any cause beyond our reasonable control. If any
                  provision or part of a provision of these Terms of Use is
                  determined to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that
                  provision or part of the provision is deemed severable from
                  these Terms of Use and does not affect the validity and
                  enforceability of any remaining provisions. There is no joint
                  venture, partnership, employment or agency relationship
                  created between you and us as a result of these Terms of Use
                  or use of the Site. You agree that these Terms of Use will not
                  be construed against us by virtue of having drafted them. You
                  hereby waive any and all defenses you may have based on the
                  electronic form of these Terms of Use and the lack of signing
                  by the parties hereto to execute these Terms of Use.
