# Contributing to JJCUSA Portal Frontend

## Reporting issues

To report an issue or make a request for a new feature please create a new feature for frontend repository on [Zenhub](https://app.zenhub.com/).

| :exclamation:  Please be cautious while creating issues on Zenhub!   |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------|

1. Click the new issue button on from the Board menu or click [here](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/jjcsa-5ed1bcd022309703adc78079/issues/jjcsa/backend/new).
2. Make sure to select the frontend repository while creating issues for the frontend.


## The Contribution Process

For contributions, it is preferred to create a new branch with the same name as the issue on Zenhub. The new branch should be based off the `developer` branch. Once ready, make sure to submit a PR from your branch into the `developer` branch.

Ideally, these general steps should be followed to contribute.

1. Open your Git Terminal and switch to the `developer` branch of the [frontend](https://github.com/JJCSA/frontend) repo
```
git checkout developer
git pull --rebase
```
| :exclamation:  Always `rebase` instead of `pull`   |
|----------------------------------------------------|

2. Resolve any  merge conflicts or commit untracked code changes, if any.
3. Create a new branch with the same name as the Zenhub issue. For example, creating a branch for issue #1
```
git checkout -b issue-1
git push -u origin issue-1
```
4. Make all your code changes for issue-1 in the `issue-1` branch.
5. Once the code changes are ready and the issue is tested, sync the branch with developer
```
git rebase developer issue-1
```
| :exclamation:  Always `rebase` instead of `merge`   |
|-----------------------------------------------------|

6. Resolve any merge conflicts before pushing the final code changes.
```
git push
```
7. Head over to GitHub to create a [new Pull Request](https://github.com/JJCSA/frontend/compare/developer...) into the `developer` branch.
8. Make sure to choose the branch correctly and add description of the code changes for the reviewer.
9. Once reviewed, merge the code changes and close the Pull Request.
10. Test the code changes on the `developer` branch
```
git checkout developer
git pull --rebase
```
11. If everything is okay, delete the `issue-1` branch and update the Zenhub issue as well.
